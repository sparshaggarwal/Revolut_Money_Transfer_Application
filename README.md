# Revolut_Money_Transfer_Application

I have used the following tech stack.

JAVA 8 
MAVEN
JDBC
H2 Database
JUNIT

Since this is a financial application, i have written JUNIT test cases (i covered only a few classes because of time constraint) and i have 
also done functional testing through POSTMAN.

Also, since this application is a banking application, i have tested it via JMETER as well, wherein multiple requests are fired. This
ensures that concurrency issues re not experienced.
